# Simulating the motion of Carbody using python
Attempting to simulate the multibody dynamics behavior of a carbody's motion as it moves in a uneven terrain. 
The simulation of the carbody is an oversimplified 3DOF multibody-dynamics system. I'm coding it from scratch, that's why it's so hard to do.

The simulation program is still not finished. Program still not working, so many errors.
